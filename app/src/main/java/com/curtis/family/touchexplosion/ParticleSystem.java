// Ideas for particle systems
//  1. Simple fireworks.
//      - Each tap of the screen causes a rocket to be fired from the corner to the target position.
//      - when it reaches the target position, it explodes.
//      - the explosion elements fade to transparent while following simple ballistic trajectories.
//  2. Flower explosion
//      - At each tap, a flower explodes.
//      - the flower center follows ballistic trajectory.
//      - Accelerate outwards, but air friction slows them quiclkly.
//      - they then have a more or less constant downward velocity with sinusoidal back and forth
//          pendulum swings.
//  3. Tinkerbell
//      - a single light sits on the screen, emitting sparks that accelerate ballistically fall.
//      - A tap on the screen causes the light to move to the tap location
//          - However, there are acceleration constraints on it, it must move with C1 continuity.
